		<h3>Hello World!</h3>

		<p>I wanted to let you know why I think you should learn to code with
			<a href="http://www.CodeFirstGirls.com" >CodeFirstGirls! </a>
		</p>

		<p><b>Who am I?</b></p>

		<ul>
			<li> I'm 26 years young! </li>
			<li> I'm a 3rd year PhD student researching retinal diseases.</li>
			<li> I am a complete coding novice! </li>
			<li> CodeFirstGirls is my first time using HTML, CSS and JS.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3> Why did I get involved?</h3>


		<p>It's a chance to get creative!</p>

		<p>Working in a lab, I often labour over experiments for days
			only for them to not work- coding attracted me because I enjoy that you can put in a piece of code
			and get a result straight away- bit of a change from my normal day job!</p>

		<p>It's also a great chance to add some new skills to your toolset, and its a boost for the CV.
			You also get to meet new people and have a bit of a laugh!</p>

		<p>The course is really well structured and built towards continued learning- all the content covered
			is shared online so you can access it any time, any where!</p>

<div class="contrast-2">
			<p>What have I learnt over the last 8 weeks:</p>

		 <ul>
				<li> The differences between html, css, and JS. </li>
				<li> How to inspect these elements in any web page. </li>
				<li> The importance of organsing your code and adding comments to help yourself and your collaborators. </li>
				<li> How to create repositories in github and work with a team on projects. </li>
				<li> How to solve conflicts! </li>
				<li> How to use bootstrap and add some nifty features to your page.</li>
				<li> The importance of the user experience and how businesses learn what the user likes.</li>
				<li> I've learnt that I enjoy coding and want to do more!</li>

		 </ul>
		</p>

<div class="contrast">
		<p> This has been a great experience for me, and I will take away so much from this course.</p>
		<p> It has even helped shape some of my potential career interests!</p>
