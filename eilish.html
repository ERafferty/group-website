		<ul>
			<li> I'm 24 years old. </li>
			<li> Currently studing a Foundation Degree in Software Engineering.</li>

		<h3> My Experience!</h3>


		<p>Over the past 8 weeks I've covered everything from how the internet works,
			to creating starter websites, understanding version control with git and
			finally collabrating on a group project.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've covered a huge amount during the course and the 8 weeks have flown by!

			<p>A few things I've learned during the course:</p>

		 <ul>
				<li> To begin code with a &lt;html&gt; tag and close the tag at the end of the finished code. </li>
				<li> To enclose the body of code in the &lt;body&gt; tag. </li>
				<li> How to create headers of different sizes &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, etc) and paragraphs using the &lt;p&gt; tag. </li>
				<li> How to create an ordered list &lt;ol&gt; and unordered lists &lt;ul&gt;. </li>
				<li> How to include a image using the &lt;img&gt; tag and links using the 'href' inside the &lt;a&gt; tag. </li>
				<li> How CCS is used a style sheet language that is describes the presenataion of HTML.</li>
				<li> That user experience is extremely important when creating a website.</li>
				<li> How git can be used by many users to work on projects collabratively</li>

		 </ul>
		</p>

		<p> I really enjoyed taking part in the CodeFirstGirls coding and really recommend it.</p>
		<p> It's a great environment to learn how to code as being a newbie coding can be daunting.
			The course is delivered by knowledgable individuals who are always willing to help.</p>
