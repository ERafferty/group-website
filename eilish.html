		<h3> My Experience!</h3>


		<p>Over the past 8 weeks I've covered everything from how the internet works,
			to creating starter websites, understanding version control with git and
			finally collabrating on a group project.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've covered a huge amount during the course and the 8 weeks have flown by!

			<p>A few things I've learned during the course:</p>

		 <ul>
				<li> To begin code with a &lt;html&gt; tag and close the tag at the end of the finished code. </li>
				<li> To enclose the body of code in the &lt;body&gt; tag. </li>
				<li> How to create headers of different sizes &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, etc) and paragraphs using the &lt;p&gt; tag. </li>
				<li> How to create an ordered list &lt;ol&gt; and unordered lists &lt;ul&gt;. </li>
				<li> How to include a image using the &lt;img&gt; tag and links using the 'href' inside the &lt;a&gt; tag. </li>
				<li> How CCS is used a style sheet language that is describes the presenataion of HTML.</li>
				<li> That user experience is extremely important when creating a website.</li>
				<li> How git can be used by many users to work on projects collabratively.</li>
				<li> How bootstrap has lots of layouts and features that can be incorperated into webpages.</li>
				<li> How Javascript is used make interactive features on webpages to improve user experience. </li>

		 </ul>
		</p>

		<p> I really enjoyed taking part in the CodeFirstGirls coding and really recommend it.</p>
		<p> It's a great environment to learn how to code as it can be daunting if you don't know where to start.
			The course is delivered by knowledgable individuals who are always willing to help out.</p>
